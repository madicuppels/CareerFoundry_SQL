This SQL query aims to find how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country by using CTEs. 

WITH top_5_customers_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country, total_amount_paid) AS
(SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country, SUM(E.amount) AS
total_amount_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A. address_id = B. address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B. city_id = C. city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C. country_id = D. country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A. customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Ambattur', 'Shanwei', 'So Leopoldo',
'Tianjin','Hami','Cianjur')
GROUP BY country, city, first_name, last_name, A.customer_id
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT D.country, COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT(top_5_customers_cte)
AS top_customer_count
FROM CUSTOMER A
INNER JOIN address B on A. address_id = B. address_id

ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
